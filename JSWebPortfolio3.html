        Actually my biggest project, it is quite complex, it fully based on API from CRM provider to company which i have worked.
        <br>
        <li>1. Get data about client and just print it out on this panel</li>
        <li>2. Make a request about documents which are placed in CRM, so if no specific documents in CRM - no documents in panel also</li>
        <li>3. Payment documents are fully donwawdable from here, Panel has it`s own engine to fill up pdf schema documents based on CRM information, because in system payment documents are created on the fly.</li>
        <li>4. Dashboard tab was invented to give clients view to their data in more representative way than from applications  provided by inverters produceres. Here i utilize Chart.js library.</li>
        <li>5. Panel give users ability to send questions for specified topic to CRM, this question is send to system as an email but more precisyly to email which belongs to department who knows how to take care of this question.
